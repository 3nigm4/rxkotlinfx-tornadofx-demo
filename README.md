#RxKotlinFX/TornadoFX Demo

This is a fully-featured demo showcasing [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) used in conjunction with [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX) to build a desktop application. It only took me two nights to make this application.

This is an [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)-driven application. A temporary backing database is stored in-memory using SQLite, and [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc) is used to reactively query and write to it. 

Clone and build it to see RxJava, Kotlin, and JavaFX working together to create powerful applications.
