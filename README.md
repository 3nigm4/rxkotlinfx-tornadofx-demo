#RxKotlinFX/TornadoFX Demo

This is a fully-featured demo showcasing [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) used in conjunction with [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX) to build a desktop application. It only took me two nights to build. 

This is an [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)-driven application. A temporary backing database is stored in-memory using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), and [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc) is used to reactively query and write to it. 

Just build it and run it with Gradle.
