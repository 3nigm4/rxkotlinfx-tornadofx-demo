A fully-featured demo showcasing a [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) used in conjunction with [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX). 

This is an [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)-driven application. A temporary backing database is stored in-memory using SQLite.  [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc) is used to reactively query and write to it. 

Clone and build it to see RxJava, Kotlin, and JavaFX working together to create powerful applications.
